### Class Selectors
The CSS class selector matches elements based on the contents of their class attribute.
All elements with class="spacious"
.spacious {
margin: 2em;
}
Element selector
Selects all elements that have the given node name.
Syntax: elementname

Example: input will match any element.

The background-color CSS property sets the background color of an element.
Syntax: background-color: color name;
The color CSS property sets the foreground color value of an element's text and text decorations, and sets the currentcolor value. currentcolor may be used as an indirect value on other properties and is the default for other color properties, such as border-color.
Syntax : color: rebeccapurple; The text-align CSS property sets the horizontal alignment of the inline-level content inside a block element or table-cell box. This means it works like vertical-align but in the horizontal direction.
Syntax: text-align: end;
border-style
The border-style shorthand CSS property sets the line style for all four sides of an element's border.
Syntax: border-style: none; justify-content
The CSS justify-content property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main-axis of a flex container, and the inline axis of a grid container. Syntax: justify-content: center;
border-width
The border-width shorthand CSS property sets the width of an element's border.
Syntax: border-width: 4px 1.25em; font-weight
The font-weight CSS property sets the weight (or boldness) of the font. The weights available depend on the font-family that is currently set.
Syntax: font-weight: 100;
letter-spacing
The letter-spacing CSS property sets the horizontal spacing behavior between text characters. This value is added to the natural spacing between characters while rendering the text. Positive values of letter-spacing causes characters to spread farther apart, while negative values of letter-spacing bring characters closer together.
syntax: letter-spacing: normal;
